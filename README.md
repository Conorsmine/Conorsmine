## About me
I'm a student from germany with a fascination for anything IT related.  
For the past 3 years I've been teaching myself the ropes, mainly in the field of application development in Java. Using tools and APIs like [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) to build and develop plugins.  
But also daveling in other areas, like hardware related projects using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) or [Hades](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/applets/hades/webdemos/download.html) to create my own ALU.  

## Interests
I love creating source code the most, but it's not my only interest.  
In my free time I like to bake, cook, play chess (while I'm not the greatest at it) and to play sports like beach Volleyball or Badminton.  

## Future Projects
I'm very ambitious and want to create several projects, some of the following are my top priorities:  
- [ ] HoloHelper
- [ ] WII-Tanks (my own recreation)
- [ ] Kaleidoscope
